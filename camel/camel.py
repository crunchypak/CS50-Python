'''
Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_),
with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.

In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name
in snake case. Assume that the userâ€™s input will indeed be in camel case.

camelCase: name                                                                 snake_case: name
'''

def main():
    camelText = input("camelCase: ")
    print("snake_case: " + camelToSnake(camelText))

def camelToSnake(camelText):
    snakeText = ""
    for c in camelText:
        if c.isupper():
            snakeText += "_"
        snakeText += c.lower()
    return snakeText

main()
