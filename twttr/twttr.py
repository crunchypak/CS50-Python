'''
When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter
was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs
that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
Input: Twitter
Output: Twttr
