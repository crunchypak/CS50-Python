'''
In a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order,
formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:
Date: 9/8/1636
1636-09-08
$ python outdated.py
Date: 8 September 1636
Date: September 8, 1636
1636-09-08
[
    "January",
    "February",
    "March",
    "April",
    "May",
    "June",
    "July",
    "August",
    "September",
    "October",
    "November",
    "December"
]

Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the userâ€™s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again.
Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
